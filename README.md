## Concept
I wanted to create a 2-player game, allowing players to compete against each other for the most points. **Munchie Gobbler** is inspired by classic games such as [*Snake*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)), [*Nibbler*]() and [*Pac-Man*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man). The players take turns controlling the **Blob**, which they move around the board to gobble **Munchies**, which may have positive or negative points. These points accumulate until all the **Munchies** have been gobbled. The final score is displayed.

### Stretch Features

Some extra features are listed below, as well whether they've been implemented.
* Animate **Blob** Moves
* Add Game Options
* Icons for the **Blob**, **Munchies**, and **Blockers**
* Different Point Values for **Munchies**
* Negative Point Values for **Munchies**
* Moving **Munchies**
* Moving **Blockers**
* 2 Moves per turn?

## Instructions

#### Game Board
The **Map** is laid out in a grid of squares. Each square can contain one of the following: the **Blob**, a **Munchie**, or a **Blocker**.

#### Gameplay
Each player takes turns choosing a move for the **Blob**. You may move one direction as many spaces as you want. You must move at least one space. You cannot move through **Blockers** or off the **Map**!
<br/>
Each **Munchie** you you encounter will be added to your **Jar**, and you will earn points.
<br/>
Beware: some **Munchies** might have negative points!
